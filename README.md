#  AI-Powered Travel Planner Agent

An AI-powered assistant built using **IBM Watsonx.ai Agentic Lab** that helps users plan personalized trips efficiently. The agent suggests destinations, generates itineraries, recommends transport and accommodation, and provides real-time weather updates and alerts â€” all through natural language interaction.

---

##  Project Overview
Travel planning can be complex and time-consuming. This project simplifies the process using an AI Agent built on IBM Watsonx.ai.  
The agent understands user preferences (destination, budget, duration, travel style) and dynamically generates personalized trip itineraries with recommendations for transport, stays, and local activities.

## IBM Watsonx.ai Agent Deployment
This Travel Planner Agent was built using **IBM Watsonx.ai Agentic Lab**:
- Granite LLM model was selected for conversational flow and itinerary generation.
- The agent was configured with **custom behavioral instructions** for personalized responses.
- Tools and services were integrated using the **Agentic Lab interface**.
- The project was deployed and tested via the **Agent Runtime Service** within IBM Cloud.

---

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: Destination, travel dates, budget, preferences (sightseeing, food, adventure, etc.).
2. **Granite LLM Processing**: Understands the user's request, crafts a day-wise itinerary.
3. **Dynamic Recommendations**: Suggests transport and accommodation options, simulates weather updates.
4. **Output**: Presents a structured, conversational response with trip details.
